# CppDungeon

CppDungeon is a C++ port and adaptation of [TDungeon](https://github.com/cassiozen/TDungeon), a small adventure game that runs in the C++ type system.

To play, start by building the provided `main.cpp` file; a CMakeFile is provided that configures the project correctly.
The compiler assertions will guide you in playing the game, unfortunately our typing tooling is not quite good enough (and my knowledge even less so) to allow for in-editor choosing of actions.
